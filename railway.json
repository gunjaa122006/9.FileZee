# Railway Configuration
# Railway will automatically detect Node.js and use package.json scripts

# No additional configuration needed - Railway auto-detects:
# - Node.js from package.json
# - Start command from package.json "start" script
# - Port from process.env.PORT

# Optional: You can add railway.json for custom config if needed
